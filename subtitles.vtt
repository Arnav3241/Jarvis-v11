00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.212
The red ball sat proudly at the top of the

00:00:02.225 --> 00:00:05.340
toybox It had been the last to be played with

00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:08.393
and anticipated it would be the next as well The

00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:11.857
other toys grumbled beneath At one time each had held

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.332
the spot of the red ball but over time they

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:17.508
had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.It was

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.223
a simple green chair There was nothing extraordinary about it

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.038
or so it seemed It was the type of chair

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.163
one would pass without even noticing it was there let

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:30.240
alone what the actual color of it was It was

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:33.403
due to this common and unassuming appearance that few people

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:36.515
actually stopped to sit in it and discover its magical

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:40.517
powers There was something in the sky What exactly was

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.220
up there wasn't immediately clear But there was definitely something

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:46.445
in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:49.645
She asked the question even though she didn't really want

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:52.960
to hear the answer It was a no-win situation since

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:56.225
she already knew If he told the truth she'd get

00:00:56.237 --> 00:01:00.102
confirmation of her worst fears If he lied she'd know

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:02.290
that he wasn't who she thought he was which would

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:05.980
be almost as bad Yet she asked the question anyway

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.955
and waited for his answer The lone lamp post of

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.392
the one-street town flickered not quite dead but definitely on

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.920
its way out Suitcase by her side she paid no

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.998
heed to the light the street or the town A

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.610
car was coming down the street and with her arm

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:24.347
outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
